See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information and how to run these programs.

This program assumes the chip is in a just out of reset state, that no
other software has configured the peripherals or adjusted clocks, etc.

derived from uart01.  This is a baseline to use for other examples.

This sparkfun board has a couple of TX/RX pins called out

The ones next to the SWCLK/SWDIO

TX PB22   SERCOM5 PAD[2] PORT FUNCTION D
RX PB23   SERCOM5 PAD[3] PORT FUNCTION D

The arduino ones in the corner

TX PA10  SERCOM0 PAD[2] FUNCTION C  SERCOM2 PAD[2]  FUNCTION D
RX PA11  SERCOM0 PAD[3] FUNCTION C  SERCOM2 PAD[3]  FUNCTION D

This example defaults to SERCOM5 the PB22/PB23 pins.  Set a define
in the code to swich to SERCOM0.

It starts by using the status bits to blast characters out, then
prints a few interesting things, and goes into a loop that echos
out what it receives.

Currently the CPUID shows 410CC601 for my part so this is an r0p1
version of the Cortex-M0+, so that version of the TRM should be used.
