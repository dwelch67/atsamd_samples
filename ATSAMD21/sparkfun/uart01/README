See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information and how to run these programs.

This program assumes the chip is in a just out of reset state, that no
other software has configured the peripherals or adjusted clocks, etc.

See blinker03 about syncbusy.  I am overdoing it in this example, not
hurting anything, costs a few clocks during init.

This sparkfun board has a couple of TX/RX pins called out

The ones next to the SWCLK/SWDIO

TX PB22   SERCOM5 PAD[2] PORT FUNCTION D
RX PB23   SERCOM5 PAD[3] PORT FUNCTION D

The arduino ones in the corner

TX PA10  SERCOM0 PAD[2] FUNCTION C  SERCOM2 PAD[2]  FUNCTION D
RX PA11  SERCOM0 PAD[3] FUNCTION C  SERCOM2 PAD[3]  FUNCTION D

The TXPO setting threw me off for a while.  RXPO the pad number is
what you put in the field.  But for TXPO if you do that for these
cases and put 2 there you get flow control, which means you need
to expose more pads, and feed the CTS.  PAD[2] with no flow control
is a TXPO of 1.

The math for the baud is a little unusual

BAUD = 65536 ( 1 - (16 (115200/8000000)))
BAUD = 65536 ( 1 - (16 (0.0144)))
BAUD = 65536 ( 1 - 0.2304)
BAUD = 65536 ( 0.7696)
BAUD = 50436.5056

This example writes U then V out both PB22 and PA10.
